A review of facility documentation revealed an undated policy and procedure titled ""Program Model: Facility Based Respite"" dated October 20, 2022. The policy and procedure stated, ""Purpose Devereux Arizona is committed to providing the least restrictive and most appropriate services to individuals referred for care. Facility Based Respite care is designed to provide short-term relief to primary caregivers (parents/guardians) of children with developmental, emotional, or behavioral needs. Respite is neither a level of care nor a therapeutic/ treatment based intervention. It is a formal, structured ""break"" for families. All Respite requests will be made with as much prior notice as possible, but no less than 24 hours. Respite care is not a substitute for crisis intervention/ stabilization, hospitalization, or residential treatment. Program Objectives The Respite Program focuses on providing safe and temporary home environments for children, while giving families and children a much needed ""break"". These regularly scheduled breaks are intended to proactively preserve the family unit, and help dissolve the need for out-of-home placement at a later time by giving the primary caregiver an opportunity to recuperate and re-charge. In this way, the primary caregiver will then be better prepared to effectively parent the child despite the challenges and stressors presented by the child and his/her behavioral health condition. All parents and caregivers need and benefit from a break from their parental duties at times, and the need for these breaks is exacerbated when raising a child or adolescent with behavioral health challenges. Devereux understands that in order for respite to serve its purpose successfully. Respite staff must be equipped with knowledge and support, and individual's individual strengths and challenges must be carefully assessed when arranging respite.""

A review of facility documentation revealed a document titled ""Incident Documentation"" created by O2, which stated, ""On April 5, 2024 at approximately 2:35 PM, an employee of the group home stopped abruptly at the security door of the school with [R1]. When [E2] stopped [E2] tensed [E2's] stance and extended [E2's] elbow, then proceeded to push [E2's] elbow into [R1's] torso. The employee [E2] and [R1] then both engaged in a verbal argument walking out the door. I then separated them both, keeping [R1] in the building while [E2] walked out... At the car, [R1] entered the vehicle and both [E2] and [R1] continued to engage verbally with each other. At one point, [E2] exited the driver's seat and postured up to [R1]. [R1] then exited the vehicle. As the vehicle moved through the roundabout in front of the office, [R1] opened the door to exit the vehicle. [E2] stopped the vehicle and [R1] exited.... During the incident that occurred on campus [officer] de-escalated [R1's] emotional reactive responses. When [E2] entered the room and spoke with [R1], [E2] argued with and, in my opinion, provoked [R1]."" 2. In a telephonic interview, [O1] reported the facility was called to pick up [R1] as [R1] had been disciplined for skipping class. When [E2] arrived at the school to pick up [R1], [E2] was observed as being ""antagonizing"" towards [R1]. [O1] reported both [R1] and [E2] were arguing back and forth with each other. [O1] reported that at one point [E2] argued with [R1] telling [R1] would fail school for skipping class. [R1] responded by stating [R1] would do better. However, [O1] reports [E2] responded by saying ""You're just saying that, you're not going to do better."" [O1] reported when [R1] and [E2] got in the van to leave the school towards the facility, [R1] got off the van as [E2] was still arguing with [R1]. [O1] however, was able to calm [R1] down and decided to transported [R1] back to the facility instead of having [E2] transport [R1] back to the facility. [O1] described [E2's] behavior as unprofessional and unnecessary as it appeared [E2] was trying to agitate [R1] more than what [R1] was already agitated. [O1] reports while walking out of the school, down the sidewalk, [R1] was walking behind [E2]. ""[E2] stopped walking and stiffened [E2's] body, mostly [E2's] arm, stuck out [E2's] elbow and [E2's] elbow hit [R1]. When [R1] stated that [E2] elbowed [R1], [E2] denied elbowing [R1] and said that if [E2] did, it was not intentional. [O1] reported [O1's] body camera was on. [O1] stated that [E2] did intentionally elbow [R1]. [O1] reported there were no injuries, marks, or bruises observed. [O1] reported [R1] was becoming more annoyed. It was also observed that [E2] took [R1's] backpack. When [R1] asked [E2] to give back the backpack, [E2] told [R1], ""No, you're not getting it back. You don't own anything. Everything is mine."" [R1] stated that [E2] always acts this way and stated ""[E2] also threatens that [E2] is going to beat our butts or beat us up."" 3. In an interview, R1 reported R1 believed E2 had ""elbowed"" R1 on purpose. 4. In an interview, E2 reported E2 did not intentionally ""elbow"" R1 but rather felt R1 was ""in E2's space"" and used E2's elbow to create space between E2 and R1, which R1 ran into. 5.

The deficient practice posed a risk as the facility was not operating as a health care institution, and the condition of the facility posed a risk to the health and safety of an individual.","A.R.S.

Â§ 36-401, as it relates to a health care institution license under A.R.S. Â§ 36-424 and 36-425. A.R.S.

The Department interprets this definition to mean that in order to be a health care institution, a place, institution, building, or agency must be providing medical services, nursing services, behavioral health services, health screening services, other health-related services, supervisory care services, personal care services, or directed care services. A place, institution, building, or agency that does not provide any of these services for an extended period of time ceases to be a health care institution, because it no longer fits within the statutory definition of 'health care institution'. If the Department determines upon performing a compliance inspection for a health care institution that a licensed 'health care institution' has not provided medical services, nursing services, behavioral health services, health screening services, other health-related services, supervisory care services, personal care services, or directed care services for 12 consecutive months, the Department shall revoke the health care institution license on the grounds that the place, institution, building, or agency is not a health care institution and thus is ineligible for licensure."" 2.

The report indicated R3's parents, high needs case manager, and probation officer were notified of the incident within thirty minutes to an hour. 4. A review of the facility's undated policies and procedures revealed a policy titled ""Personnel."" The subcategory of the policy titled ""Behavioral Health Technician"" stated, ""...Must be able to implement treatment goals and objectives and adhere to all facilityâ??s policies and procedures..."" 5. A review of the facility's daily staffing schedules revealed E1, a behavioral health technician, was the sole personnel member on the premises at the time of the aforementioned incidents. The daily staffing schedules did not include on-call personnel. 6. A review of the facility's policies and procedures revealed an undated policy titled "" [Absent Without Leave]/Absconding."" The policy stated, ""A resident that leaves the premises without permission, especially in a hurridely manner or secretly is considered AWOL [Absent Without Leave] status. If a staff member suspects that a resident is contemplating to abscond/AWOL, they will process with the resident, continue to monitor the resident and notify administration. If the resident confirms that they plan to abscond, crisis will be notified, so that further assessment can be completed, to determine if the resident is a danger to themselves. In the event that a resident absconds staff will follow outside to determine the direction the resident went. If the resident begins to run, staff will not chase them, as that may cause more of an unsafe environment. Staff will notify the administrator, police, child protective services, and parent/guardian within 30 minutes to [one] hour. An incident report will be written and maintained in the resident's record."" However, E1 did not adhere to the facility's policies and procedures because E1 did not contact crisis or the administrator when E1 became aware of the resident's plan to abscond. 7. In an interview, E6 reported to believe one personnel member present on the premises was sufficient to meet the needs of R1, R2, and R3, at the time they absconded. 8. In an exit interview, E6 and E7 reported E1 had the qualifications, education, skills, knowledge, and experience to meet the needs of R1, R2, and R3 despite the residents' successful absconding from the residence. The findings were discussed with E6 and E7 and no additional comments or documentation were provided. Plan of Correction Name, title and/or Position of the Person Responsible Jessica Patterson Administrator Date temporary correction was implemented Temporary Solution All staff were individually debriefed on handling an AWOL the minute they suspect a resident is contemplating going AWOL. The policy was reviewed, and the deficiency at hand was discussed to review how the incident could have been better handled. The staff 2025-04-30 Date permanent correction will be complete 2025-07-01 member involved in the complaint was given a verbal reprimand for not following policy. The administrator reviewed the policy to manage the process better when a resident is contemplating going AWOL or has gone AWOL. Permanent Solution All daily staffing schedules will include on-call personnel, so that it is well documented. A mandatory staff meeting will review the necessary steps if a resident contemplates AWOL, including the most recent updates once the POC is approved. The IR documentation will be updated to provide more detailed step- by-step information. The staffing schedule will be changed to provide additional oversight by having two staff members scheduled for a minimum of an hour past the time the residents go to bed. The second staff member will notify the administrator if any resident is still awake fifteen minutes before their shift ends. The resident's guardian will be contacted if a staff member suspects a resident is going AWOL, so they can attempt to discourage the resident. Verbal de-escalation techniques will be reviewed annually in therapeutic options to include case scenarios for AWOL. The staff members will notify the administrator anytime there is a ""rumor"" that a resident is going AWOL, so the administrator, clinician, or crisis team can assess the resident. Monitoring The administrative assistant will review all staffing schedules monthly to ensure they include on-call personnel. The administrator will review and approve all AWOL IRs and create all staffing schedules to ensure two staff members are scheduled while the residents are awake. The director will provide the therapeutic options training to ensure that all staff members understand the verbal de- escalation that needs to occur, not only when a resident is acting out, but also when the resident is planning to make a decision that could create an unsafe environment for them, including AWOL."

If a resident does AWOL, staff will attempt to determine the direction in which he is headed. The administrator or a designated staff member will drive around the area to look for the resident. The police will be notified, and a police report will be made so they can also look for the resident. The staff will notify DCS that the resident is a runaway. The parents/guardians will be notified and updated. If the resident is unwilling to return to the home, the parents/guardians will be advised, as they may need to intervene with the next steps. If the resident returns, the staff will keep the resident in line of sight, including sleeping in the front room on a mattress next to the staff's office. The administrator, clinician, or crisis team will be called so that they can speak with the resident to determine if the resident appears regulated. Monitoring The administrator will ensure the guardian/parent was called by checking the EMR documentation for the phone call note.

Permanent Solution Zarephath has implemented a process to ensure that all youth attending respite services with prescribed medications have current medication orders on file. Communication outlining this requirement is now being sent to guardians and case managers and will continue to be sent on an ongoing basis. Zarephathâ??s electronic medical record (EMR) system includes a compliance tracking feature specifically for medication orders, which supports both our documentation efforts and our ongoing compliance project. For all new referrals and intakes, medication orders will be requested at the time of admission. For current youth already receiving services, any missing medication orders will be actively requested from the assigned health agency until documentation is obtained and compliance is achieved. If medication orders cannot be obtained directly from the health agency, Zarephath will verify the prescription with the dispensing pharmacy to ensure the label reflects a current, active order. A Behavioral Health Professional (BHP) will then authenticate the verified information and ensure it is appropriately filed in the residentâ??s medical record. Monitoring Zarephath will monitor medication order compliance by reviewing the EMR before each respite admission to ensure all orders are current. Weekly audits will be conducted for existing respite clients to identify and follow up on any missing medication orders. Additionally, Zarephath will review compliance quarterly to address any issues and ensure ongoing adherence until 100% compliance is achieved."

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this program with the DCF Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-124. Additionally, a review was conducted on 11-7-23 by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A full standard of compliance was issued. A copy of the nursing site visit summary report is included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance utilizing the SDP template included with this report. The service development plan must be submitted to the assigned Regulatory Consultant within 30 days of receipt of this emailed report.\nAlso included in this report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken, or, highlight areas for improvement. Recommendations do not require the submission of a service development plan.\nThe areas of regulatory noncompliance are as follows:\n17a-145-86\tInstructions in Safety Procedures. Supervision\n•\tNo fire drills were completed during the 3rd quarter of 2023.\nRecommendation: No recommendations made in this report.\nOnce the Licensing Unit has reviewed and accepted the service development plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations, a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision, the current license will remain in effect. Should you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to contact me at (860) 937-7551.\nSincerely,\nJames Funaro\n_____________________________\nJames Funaro\nDCF Regulatory Consultant\nCopy: file\nExecutive Director|",

Additionally, a review was conducted on 11-7-23 by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A full standard of compliance was issued. A copy of the nursing site visit summary report is included with this report. \r\n\r\nListed below are the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance utilizing the SDP template included with this report. The service development plan must be submitted to the assigned Regulatory Consultant within 30 days of receipt of this emailed report.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken, or, highlight areas for improvement. Recommendations do not require the submission of a service development plan. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe areas of regulatory noncompliance are as follows:\r\n\r\n17a-145-86\tInstructions in Safety Procedures. Supervision\r\n•\tNo fire drills were completed during the 3rd quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendation: No recommendations made in this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the Licensing Unit has reviewed and accepted the service development plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations, a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision, the current license will remain in effect. Should you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to contact me at (860) 937-7551.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJames Funaro\r\n_____________________________\r\nJames Funaro\r\nDCF Regulatory Consultant\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy: file         \r\n          Executive Director|",

Please review areas identified and submit a service development plan to address each area.\nThe plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. Steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance. 2. The date correction(s) will be completed. The areas of non-compliance are as follows:\nSection 17a-145-63: Chief Administrative Officer.\n(Evidence) Upon reviewing incident reports, it was noted that residents have repeatedly refused to comply with the group home rules. If these incidents are not addressed promptly and appropriately, they have the potential to pose a safety risk to both the individuals involved and others within the program.\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the front door was worn from daily use, and it needs to be addressed.\nSection 17a-145-74: Lavatory Facilities.\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the second-floor bathroom contained a light fixture with a rusted frame, and it needs to be addressed.\nSection 17a-145-76: Kitchen.\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the dishwasher door was dented, and it needs to be addressed.\nSection 17a-145-86: Instruction in Safety Procedure. Supervision.\n(Evidence) Upon review of fire drill records, for 2024 there was no first shift drill conducted in the first quarter, and in 2025, there was no third shift conducted in the first quarter.\nOnce a finding is made that your agency has satisfactorily addressed the regulatory compliance issues, and all required supplementary materials have been received, the Department of Children and Families will be prepared to issue a regular license. Failure to submit a plan of correction or successfully implement a plan will result in the refusal to renew the license.

Please review areas identified and submit a service development plan to address each area.\r\n\r\nThe plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. Steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance. 2. The date correction(s) will be completed. The areas of non-compliance are as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-63: Chief Administrative Officer.  \r\n(Evidence) Upon reviewing incident reports, it was noted that residents have repeatedly refused to comply with the group home rules. If these incidents are not addressed promptly and appropriately, they have the potential to pose a safety risk to both the individuals involved and others within the program.\r\n\r\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the front door was worn from daily use, and it needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-74: Lavatory Facilities.\r\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the second-floor bathroom contained a light fixture with a rusted frame, and it needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-76: Kitchen.\r\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the physical plant, the dishwasher door was dented, and it needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-86: Instruction in Safety Procedure. Supervision.\r\n(Evidence) Upon review of fire drill records, for 2024 there was no first shift drill conducted in the first quarter, and in 2025, there was no third shift conducted in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nOnce a finding is made that your agency has satisfactorily addressed the regulatory compliance issues, and all required supplementary materials have been received, the Department of Children and Families will be prepared to issue a regular license. Failure to submit a plan of correction or successfully implement a plan will result in the refusal to renew the license. Should you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report, please do not hesitate to call me at (959) 255-0615.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPenny Woodward\r\n\r\nPenny Woodward, LCSW\r\nRegulatory Consultant\r\nDepartment of Children and Families\r\n505 Hudson Street\r\nHartford, CT. 06016\r\nPhone: 959-255-0615\r\nFax: 860-550-6665\r\npenny.woodward@ct.gov|",

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this program with the Regulations of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities Regulations 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-124.\nAdditionally, an onsite review was conducted by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN on 6-3-24 to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A 'full standard of compliance' is documented in the report, which will be forwarded to the program. A copy of the nursing review site visit summary report is also included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of DCF regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and complete a licensing regulation compliance plan (RCP) to address each area of noncompliance. The completed regulation compliance plan and any applicable supporting documentation must be submitted to the assigned Regulatory Consultant within 30 days of receipt of this emailed report.\nThe areas of regulatory noncompliance are as follows:\n17a-145-52  \t Interstate Placement of Children.\n'Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children - Report on Child's Placement Status' (form 100B) was not found in five case records (EC, KS, OK, SR, VT) to reflect a change in placement from a previous Turnbridge program in another town. No new ICPC 100B forms were completed to document the change in placement to the extended care/sober living program in North Haven, CT.\nIn four (4) open records reviewed (EC, KS, OK, SR), letters from the Turnbridge Admissions Department to Interstate Compact incorrectly state that the child was admitted to the Woodbury, CT Residential Treatment program rather than the Killingworth, CT Residential Treatment program. The Woodbury, CT campus has served only males since August 2022.\n17a-145-06   \tDischarge of a Child.\nThe discharge summary report in one closed case record (SG) does not include information on if the client left the program with the legal guardian. Discharge of a child shall only be to the legal guardian, or to someone else with written authorization from the legal guardian.\n17a-145-98   \tCase Records. Reports. Confidentiality.\nThe individual treatment plans (Wellness Plans) in thirteen (13) open case records do not contain a client's signature in accordance with agency policy. Additionally, the plans do not contain discharge planning information, to include a target date for discharge.\n******************************************************************************\nOnce the Licensing Unit has reviewed and accepted the service development plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations, a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision, the current license will remain in effect.\nShould you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to contact me at (860) 937-7551.\nSincerely,\nKathleen Forsythe, LCSW\nRegulatory Consultant\nCc: Program Director|",

A copy of the nursing review site visit summary report is included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of DCF regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and complete a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance.

Programs are required to notify the department whenever significant staff changes are made.  Based on the application submitted the Group Home is licensed for 3:12 ratio on all three shifts.  DPM had increased the ratio on 2nd shift to 4:12 to accommodate the census (LBC 12) due to safety and acuity of the clients.  The building has four floors and utilizes all four during parts of day.  It is a challenge for staff to monitor and supervise youth during awake hours and still meet program clinical, education, recreation needs, safely.  At issue, DPM changed the staff ratio to 2:12 on 1st and 3rd shifts and 2nd shift will be 3:12.  Due to the mental health needs and mixed population (female/male) combined with staff expectations and physical plant challenges the loss of one staff has had a negative impact on staff's ability to provide a safe nurturing environment.  In addition, the program lost one clinician. Overall, the mental health acuity of clients admitted has not changed but gotten worse.   DPM must maintain the same staffing ratio regardless of census.  If the staff ratio needs to change the agency is required to notify the DCF Licensing unit for approval.  \r\nb)\tFailed to notify the DCF Licensing of change in nursing coverage.  Stamford and Fairfield are using the Southport GH RN to conduct admission assessments.  The program utilizes virtual RN coverage and there is no plan to have a RN on site.  The RN last site 9/6/24.  The LPN completes assessments, and the RN completes her assessment virtually with the LPN or Mental Health Techs present.  \r\nc)\tStaff report the acuity of patients admitted has risen and most are coming directly from a psychiatric hospital creating an unpredictable and unsafe environment as these changes are taking place.  The increase of Exceptional Circumstance Reports is increased and with several CPI holds increased reported.  \r\nd)\tA refrigerator and Freezer are broken, and parts unavailable to fix or repair.  Staff use a small refrigerator located in the laundry room (which is locked) to get food. Residents are no longer able to get food on their own but must ask staff for snacks or other foods from the laundry room.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-73.  Sleeping accommodations. \r\nEvidence: Condition of bedroom on second floor.\r\n•\tSecond floor bedroom called 'Yellow Double Room', has two twin beds.  The bed in the far-left corner, window side, of room is sunken several inches over the past several weeks.  Program reports this is very new and recently reported. Staff pointed out the main hallway on the second floor appears to be in a similar condition.  Also new.  Licensing advised staff to move youth to the other bed in the same room, but level.  Even though the room size is large enough for 2 youths and beds; only one youth can sleep in this room until the floor is replaced or repaired. The agency should immediately investigate the safety of the floor and any potential impact to the program.  In addition, the agency must make appropriate accommodations if the remaining youth should have to move from the room and relocate elsewhere in the building up to and including supervision.  DCF Licensing must be notified of any plan and approve that plan.  Program must submit any building permits as required by Stamford building inspector, if applicable. \r\n•\tRoom # 4.  The bedframe is broken.\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-Lavatory facilities.\r\nEvidence: The shower stall (hygiene bathroom) is not used because the residents complain the water pressure is too low to shower. \r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-75.  Health and medical treatment.\r\nEvidence:  No evidence of RN working on site or visiting the building for Stamford and Fairfield Group Homes. There have been 13 admissions since 10/1/24 for Stamford.    Mental Health Technicians are present during some virtual assessments if an LPN is not on duty.  There have been several incidents of residents being restrained, but no RN came on site to provide a medical review of youth. \r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-76. Kitchen, equipment, food -handling.\r\nEvidence:  \r\n•\tThe façade of the cabinets in the kitchen are in poor condition due to wear and tear. The carousel in the kitchen next to the stove is broken and needs to be repaired.\r\n•\tThe kitchen stove is missing a protective cover which is used to cover the gas pipe to prevent someone from accidently kicking the pipe.\r\n•\tThe refrigerator handle is broken and one of the door shelves is broken.  \r\n•\tThe freezer handle is broken, and staff report the seal is broken to. It is not being used. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nErrolee Miller, RN BSN MSN conducted an unannounced visit to program 11/8//24.\r\nSection 17 a-145-93. Medical, dental, and nursing care - Health Care Standards of Children and Youth in Care and DPH RN Scope of practice and CT State Law.\r\nEvidence:  \r\nDuring an unannounced visit to program on 11/8/24, interview with youths and staff and review of RN visit record identified the following violation:\r\nViolations\r\nFacility failed to provide an ongoing and consistent RN coverage to perform in person assessments or evaluation of youths, supervision of LPNs and oversight of medication certified staff since August 2024. It was noted that RN was providing these duties remotely which was not within the jurisdiction of the DCF Regulation or State law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease submit a plan of correction to address the above referenced areas of non-compliance within 30 days of receipt of this report.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this facility with the Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98, as well as the DCF Guidelines for the Administration of Medication by Certified Staff and the DCF Nursing Standards.  Below are listed the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a Service Development Plan to address each area.  The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance; and 2. the date the correction(s) will be completed.  The areas of non-compliance are listed on the attached DCF Licensing Report form. Please use this form to submit the Service Development Plan as well.

Until DCF makes this decision the current license will remain in effect. \r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to call me at (203) 675-6975.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__Thomas S.

The facility failed to provide appropriate medical intervention when youth left facility via absence without official leave (AWOL). Youth was admitted to facility 05/09/2023 with diagnosis that included disruptive mood dysregulation and alcohol use disorder. Last psych evaluation completed 08/2023. A review of a complaint submitted from youth; adverse event report identified youth did not receive medication as a result of AWOL. A review of youth's medication administration record (MAR) identified a physician's order dated 09/2023 that directed youth to have Lamictal 100 MG po every morning, Cymbalta 60 MG po every evening, Latuda 20 MG po every evening and melatonin 5 MG po every evening. Further review of MAR identified that there were three missed medications Latuda 20 MG, Cymbalta 60 MG, and Melatonin 5 MG that were not administered on the following dates -09/23, 09/24, 09/26 and 09/27/2023. A review of clinical record failed to identify a nursing or medical assessment that was performed during or after each AWOL event. A review of physician's orders failed to identify directive to withhold medication for days noted. Interview with APRN and MD on 09/28/2023 identified that staff provided update to nurse that youth had AWOL, nurse/staff provided update to MD and only an oral directive was given to withhold medication each time youth AWOL. (Per regulation telephone orders can legally be accepted only by a pharmacist or a nurse. Facility's policy must identify the timeframe during which licensed practitioners must cosign any telephone order and must not exceed 30 days the facility failed to meet this requirement). The nurse at facility failed to transcribe order for staff to follow and failed to perform an assessment after youth AWOL. A review of facility's AWOL policy directed in part that if a resident is observed to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, the resident must be medically cleared by the town's hospital or nearby hospital. The facility will recommend to hospital that a physical exam, drug test, gynecological exam (if applicable), mental status exam and possible medication evaluation and administration occur (facility staff called EMS and police, Youth was not taken to hospital based on Police/ EMS decision)."

The facility failed to provide appropriate medical intervention when youth left facility via absence without official leave (AWOL). Youth was admitted to facility 05/09/2023 with diagnosis that included disruptive mood dysregulation and alcohol use disorder. Last psych evaluation completed 08/2023. A review of a complaint submitted from youth; adverse event report identified youth did not receive medication as a result of AWOL.  \r\nA review of youth's medication administration record (MAR) identified a physician's order dated 09/2023 that directed youth to have Lamictal 100 MG po every morning, Cymbalta 60 MG po every evening, Latuda 20 MG po every evening and melatonin 5 MG po every evening. Further review of MAR identified that there were three missed medications Latuda 20 MG, Cymbalta 60 MG, and Melatonin 5 MG that were not administered on the following dates -09/23, 09/24, 09/26 and 09/27/2023. A review of clinical record failed to identify a nursing or medical assessment that was performed during or after each AWOL event. A review of physician's orders failed to identify directive to withhold medication for days noted. Interview with APRN and MD on 09/28/2023 identified that staff provided update to nurse that youth had AWOL, nurse/staff provided update to MD and only an oral directive was given to withhold medication each time youth AWOL. (Per regulation telephone orders can legally be accepted only by a pharmacist or a nurse. Facility's policy must identify the timeframe during which licensed practitioners must cosign any telephone order and must not exceed 30 days the facility failed to meet this requirement). The nurse at facility failed to transcribe order for staff to follow and failed to perform an assessment after youth AWOL. \r\n\r\nA review of facility's AWOL policy directed in part that if a resident is observed to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, the resident must be medically cleared by the town's hospital or nearby hospital. The facility will recommend to hospital that a physical exam, drug test, gynecological exam (if applicable), mental status exam and possible medication evaluation and administration occur (facility staff called EMS and police, Youth was not taken to hospital based on Police/ EMS decision).\r\n\r\nPlease submit a plan of correction to address the above referenced areas of non-compliance within 30 days of receipt of this report.

Please review areas identified and submit a plan of correction to address each area.\nThe plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. Steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance. 2. The date correction(s) will be completed.  The areas of non-compliance are as follows:\n17a-145-61: Written policies and procedures.\n(Evidence) Upon review of agency manual, the program did not follow policies on no tobacco use at the group home or no contraband in the facility. The supervision of students' policy was outdated, and it needs to be amended to reflect current practices.\n17a-145-63: Chief administrative officer.\n(Evidence) Upon review of case record information and reports, the program failed to ensure the safety of clients by not adhering to the no tobacco use policy.\n(Evidence) Upon inspection of the front entrance, a railing pole was missing, and it needs to be addressed. Upon inspection of the physical plant, the patio area contained discoloration in multiple sections and two light fixtures had an excessive amount of rust. The citations need to be addressed. The basement window contained an extensive amount of dirt and debris, and it needs to be addressed.\n17a-145-73: Sleeping accommodations.\n(Evidence) Upon review of the physical plant, residents' bedrooms were not always neatly organized or therapeutically designed to meet the individual needs of residents.\n17a-145-86: Instruction in safety procedures.\n(Evidence) Upon review of program documentation, in 2023 a second shift drill was not conducted in the fourth quarter. On multiple occasions fire drill documentation was incomplete and forms were not filled out to show that regulatory requirements had been met.\n17a-145-90: Clothing, storage.\n(Evidence) Upon review of residents' bedrooms, the program did not always ensure that clients' clothing and personal items were being properly stored.\nOnce licensing has reviewed and accepted the service development plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations, a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four-month license for the program will be made. Until DCF makes this decision the current license will remain in effect. Please be advised that failure to submit an acceptable service development plan within the specified time frame may lead to a licensing action up to and including revocation.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this agency with the Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 to 17a-145-98. Below are listed the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan to address each area.  The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance; and 2. the date the correction(s) will be completed.  Also included in the report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken.  Recommendations are also made in order to enhance program functioning.  Recommendations do not require the submission of a service development plan.\nThe areas of non-compliance identified are as follows:\nSection 17a-145-64. Personnel policies and procedures.\nEvidence:  Two personnel files were reviewed.\nCPR: One file did not have evidence of CPR certification.\nSection 17a-145-86.

Until DCF makes this decision the current license will remain in effect.  Please be advised that failure to submit an acceptable service development plan within the specified time frame may lead to licensing action up to and including revocation.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this agency with the Licensure of the Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98. Below are listed the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a Service Development Plan to address each area.  The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance; and 2. the date the correction(s) will be completed.  The areas of non-compliance are listed on the attached DCF Licensing Report form. Please use this form to submit the Service Development Plan as well.  Also included in the report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken.  Recommendations do not require the submission of a plan of a Service Development Plan.\n17a-145-61. Written Policy and Procedures.\nEvidence:  At the time of the licensing visit, the Program did not have a policy and procedure for supervising children on 3rd shift.  A policy was created and accepted by licensing.\n17a-145-76. Kitchen, equipment, food-handling.\nEvidence:  The kick plate is missing from the dishwasher.\nSection 17a-145-77. Dining areas and supervision.\nEvidence:  The door separating the foyer from dining room was removed and not put back.  It should be put back in its original condition.\nDCF Reg: 17a-145-75 (f) and 17a- 6(g)- 16(d). Provide and maintain proper, safe storage for all medications according to current drug control and pharmacy regulations as outlined in the DCF Medication administration program.\nEvidence: On inspection of medication room at facility, expired medication noted included equate nasal spray exp: 09/2021, diphen hydronate 25 MG tabs exp: 10/2020\nMedication that belonged to other youths that were no longer placed in the program, which included Vitamin D3 100 IU, Metformin HCL ER 500, Aripiprazole 5 Mg tablets, Epinephrine Inj 0.3 MG, boxes of insulin needles/syringes, Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12 % mouthwash, and Fluticasone Prop 50 MCG nasal spray.\nA review of facility's Disposing of Expired and Unused Medications policy dated 06/19/2028 identified that the purpose of the policy was to ensure the safety of group home residents, all expired and unused medication should be disposed of in the proper manner. The policy further identified that the procedure is all expired and unused medication, except for controlled drugs, be destroyed by nurse, or designee, within one week, following the expiration date, or date the medication had been discontinued by following the Department of Connecticut Environmental Protection guidelines. Based on the above evidence, the facility failed to meet the requirements and did not follow policy expectation to dispose medication.\nOnce licensing has reviewed and accepted the Service Development Plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision the current license will remain in effect.\nShould you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to call me at (203) 675-6975.\nSincerely,\nThomas S. Cuchara\n_______________________________________\nRegulatory Consultant\nCopy: file|",

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this agency with the Licensure of the Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98. Below are listed the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a Service Development Plan to address each area.  The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance; and 2. the date the correction(s) will be completed.  The areas of non-compliance are listed on the attached DCF Licensing Report form. Please use this form to submit the Service Development Plan as well.  Also included in the report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken.  Recommendations do not require the submission of a plan of a Service Development Plan. \r\n\r\n\r\n17a-145-61. Written Policy and Procedures. \r\nEvidence:  At the time of the licensing visit, the Program did not have a policy and procedure for supervising children on 3rd shift.  A policy was created and accepted by licensing.\r\n\r\n\r\n17a-145-76. Kitchen, equipment, food-handling.\r\nEvidence:  The kick plate is missing from the dishwasher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17a-145-77. Dining areas and supervision.\r\nEvidence:  The door separating the foyer from dining room was removed and not put back.  It should be put back in its original condition.\r\n\r\nDCF Reg: 17a-145-75 (f) and 17a- 6(g)- 16(d). Provide and maintain proper, safe storage for all medications according to current drug control and pharmacy regulations as outlined in the DCF Medication administration program.\r\nEvidence: On inspection of medication room at facility, expired medication noted included equate nasal spray exp: 09/2021, diphen hydronate 25 MG tabs exp: 10/2020\r\nMedication that belonged to other youths that were no longer placed in the program, which included Vitamin D3 100 IU, Metformin HCL ER 500, Aripiprazole 5 Mg tablets, Epinephrine Inj 0.3 MG, boxes of insulin needles/syringes, Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12 % mouthwash, and Fluticasone Prop 50 MCG nasal spray. \r\n\r\nA review of facility's Disposing of Expired and Unused Medications policy dated 06/19/2028 identified that the purpose of the policy was to ensure the safety of group home residents, all expired and unused medication should be disposed of in the proper manner. The policy further identified that the procedure is all expired and unused medication, except for controlled drugs, be destroyed by nurse, or designee, within one week, following the expiration date, or date the medication had been discontinued by following the Department of Connecticut Environmental Protection guidelines. Based on the above evidence, the facility failed to meet the requirements and did not follow policy expectation to dispose medication.\r\n\r\nOnce licensing has reviewed and accepted the Service Development Plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision the current license will remain in effect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of this report please do not hesitate to call me at (203) 675-6975.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nThomas S. Cuchara\r\n_______________________________________\r\nRegulatory Consultant\r\n\r\nCopy: file|",

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this program with the DCF Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-124. Additionally, a review was conducted on 10-18-23 by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A full standard of compliance was issued. A copy of the nursing site visit summary report is included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance utilizing the SDP template included with this report.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this agency with the Licensure of the Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98. Below are listed the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a Regulatory Compliance Plan to address each area.  The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance; and 2. the date the correction(s) will be completed.  The areas of non-compliance are listed on the attached DCF Licensing Report form. Please use this form to submit the Regulatory Compliance Plan as well.  Also included in the report are recommendations.\nSection 17a-145-73. Sleeping accommodations.\nEvidence: During the inspection, the window in room 1BD was found to have numerous large cracks.

The steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance.  2. The date the correction(s) will be completed. The areas of non-compliance identified are as follows:\nSection 17a-145-52: Interstate placement of children.\nEvidence: Upon review of case records, one file did not contain interstate placement information as required by regulation.\nSection 17a-145-61: Written policies and procedures.\nEvidence: Upon review of the agency manual, there were no policies on the process for removal of personal items from a client's bedroom when there is a safety concern. The policy for clients on a high-risk status needs to be amended and the requirement for residents to only wear loose fitting shoes must be removed. Policy on room searches was not included in the manual and information needs to be added.\nSection 17a-145-71: Living room lounge.\nEvidence: Upon inspection of the Cedar Unit, the lounge flooring was heavily scratched and worn from daily use.

Residential Treatment Facility\nInspectors Keith Bryan, James Funaro and Patrick Hughes\nDear Dr. Murray\nOn 11/7/24 and 11/8/24, a biennial licensing inspection was conducted at your facility. This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this facility with the Regulations for Operation of Child Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-151-98, as well as the DCF Guidelines for the Administration of Medication for Certified Staff. DCF has determined that the program is in compliance with applicable regulatory provisions except those itemized below.  Please review the sections identified and submit a plan of correction to address each area. The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the areas of non-compliance; 2. the date correction(s) will be completed; and 3. steps to be taken to prevent recurrence of the citation. Also included in the report are recommendations. Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance but may become non-complaint if actions aren’t taken.

DCF has determined that the program is in compliance with applicable regulatory provisions except those itemized below.  Please review the sections identified and submit a plan of correction to address each area. The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the areas of non-compliance; 2. the date correction(s) will be completed; and 3. steps to be taken to prevent recurrence of the citation.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this facility with the Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98, the Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Guidelines, and the DCF Guidelines for the Administration of Medication by Certified Staff.\nPlease review the areas identified and submit the regulatory compliance plan of correction to address each area.

The areas of non-compliance are as follows:\nRegulations for the Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities\nSection 17a-145-96. Discharge of child.\nEvidence: Four discharge files were reviewed. At the time of the inspection, one youth was discharged to Yale New Haven Hospital and admitted to the child/adolescent psychiatric unit.  The record did not have documentation of the name of the staff or job title of the person who admitted youth.  The parent was notified by the facility their child was being discharged from BGV PRTF and transported to Yale New Haven Hospital. When youth are discharged from a program and subsequently admitted to the Hospital, the name and/or job title of responsible to admit the youth should be documented in the case record.  The program reviewed the discharge procedure and made corrections to include the name and job title of the admitting staff.  The agency' provided a written response which is accepted by licensing. No further action required.\nSec. 17a-16.  Rights of children and youths under the supervision of the Commissioner of Children and Families.\nEvidence: 6 client files were reviewed.  At the time of the inspection, files reviewed found that staff created an approved call list by using the document found in the electronic file system, CareLogic,  However, the Policy & Procedure clearly states an approved call list cannot be established, but a restricted call list is allowed.

The incident involved inappropriate sexual contact between a resident from the PRTF Program and a client from the fifth-year day school program that is on the CCOH Campus.\r\n\r\nFemale PRTF resident (age 14) was working in the kitchen, in the vocational program and requested to use the bathroom. Instead of being escorted to the bathroom that residents use, she was taken to the staff bathroom that is in a remote area next to the kitchen. The resident was left unsupervised in the bathroom and staff returned to the kitchen area. When the female resident did not return to her workstation, a kitchen staff went to check on her and resident stated that she was okay but did not open the door.  The staff left the area and returned to the kitchen. When the resident had not returned to her workstation, a second kitchen staff went to check on her and requested that she open the door.  When the resident opened the door, the staff saw that she was not alone and there was a male client in the bathroom with her.\r\n\r\nCameras are in the dining hall but not in the kitchen or hallway where the staff bathroom is located. Video footage reviewed by the program showed that the male client (age 18) was eating breakfast in the dining hall, around 8:14am he left the area and went to the kitchen.  At 8:17am, a staff in the dining hall noticed that the male client was missing and began searching for him. The male client returned to the dining hall around 8:28am and it was reported that he had been missing for a total of fourteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThe male client was a participant of the fifth-year day school program that is on campus and it is unclear what prior contact he had with the female resident.  It is suspected by staff that they may have met while during a school activity.  The male client was expelled on the day of the incident.\r\n\r\nPhysical plant: A walkthrough of Marcy, Heaton and Brewster Units was conducted with the VP of Residential Services. Male residents have been relocated to the Marcy Unit and female residents have been moved to the Brewster and Heaton Units. The cottages were appropriately furnished but the décor was below standard and needs to be addressed. \r\n\r\nCorrections implemented as a result of previous visit: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRecommendations: (The following areas were not identified as regulatory non-compliance, but are recommended to be addressed in order to enhance program functioning) \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAreas of regulatory non-compliance identified during this visit:\r\n\r\n17a-145-61: Written policies and procedures. \r\nUpon review of program documentation, the female client arrived at the kitchen around 8:07am and supervision of the youth was transferred to kitchen staff. Records show that kitchen staff are not trained on procedures for supervising clients in the residential program or have knowledge about bathroom policy.  Evidence was found that the program failed to follow its own policies and procedures for the supervision of clients.\r\n\r\n17a-145-63: Chief administrative officer.  \r\nUpon review of program documentation, the bathroom door was opened and unlocked and kitchen staff had not cleared the bathroom before allowing client to use it.  The bathroom was in a remote hallway, staff returned to the kitchen and left the client unsupervised.  Evidence was found that the program failed to ensure the safety of children by allowing untrained staff to supervise a client while participating in an on campus vocational program. \r\n\r\nUpon review of program documentation, staff from the day school was supposed to be supervising the male client but information show that staff had not been properly positioned and all areas in the dining hall were not monitored. Evidence was found that the program failed to ensure that adult participants in the fifth-year program do not have contact with clients from the PRTF Program.\r\n\r\nPlease submit a plan of correction to address the above referenced areas of non-compliance within 30 days of receipt of this report.  The plan of correction must be submitted to the attention of the undersigned at the address listed above. \r\n\r\n\r\nPenny Woodward, LCSW                          March 15, 2023\r\nRegulatory Consultant                                   Date\r\n           \r\n\r\nA COPY OF THIS SUMMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FACILITY / PROGRAM|",

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this facility with the Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-98, the Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Guidelines, and the DCF Guidelines for the Administration of Medication by Certified Staff.\nPlease review the areas identified and submit the regulatory compliance plan of correction to address each area. The plan must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of this letter and should identify: 1. the steps to be taken to correct the non-compliance and 2. the date correction(s) will be completed. The areas of non-compliance are as follows:\nRegulations for the Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities\n17a-145-73 Sleeping accommodations.\nEvidence: The bedroom doors in bedrooms #1 & # 4 in the Brainard Building rub against the floor and have caused scratches and marks to the bedroom floors.\nEvidence: The bedroom door in bedrooms #1 in the Goodwin Building rubs against the floor and has caused scratches and marks to the bedroom floor.\nEvidence: The top of the staircase leading to Goodwin Building bedroom hallway there is a piece of floorboard loose and sticking up creating a tripping hazard.\n17a-145-74 Lavatory facilities. Toilet articles and linens.\nEvidence: The large bathroom on the second floor of the Brainard Building has 2 shower stalls that have missing bathroom tile / tiled soap dishes leaving an opening exposing patches of what appears to be old, hardened tile grout.\n17a-145-76 Kitchens, equipment, food handling.\nEvidence: The cabinet trim is missing from under the stove in the Brainard                     building kitchen.\nPsychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Guidelines\nCFR 483.358 Orders for the Use of Restraint or Seclusion.\nEvidence: 1 case record had one incident of restraint where the restraint ordered was different from the restraint that was performed.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this program with the DCF Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-124. Additionally, a review was conducted on 11-14-23 by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A full standard of compliance was issued. A copy of the nursing site visit summary report is included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance utilizing the SDP template included with this report. The service development plan must be submitted to the assigned Regulatory Consultant within 30 days of receipt of this emailed report.\nAlso included in this report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken, or, highlight areas for improvement. Recommendations do not require the submission of a service development plan.\nThe areas of regulatory noncompliance are as follows:\n17a-145-86\tInstructions in Safety Procedures. Supervision\n•\tIn 2023, no fire drills were completed on 2nd and 3rd shift for the Third Quarter; no fire drills were completed on 1st and 2nd shift for the Second Quarter; no fire drills completed for any shift for the First Quarter.\n•\tIn 2022, no fire drills were completed on 1st and 3rd shift for the 4th Quarter; no fire drills completed on 1st and 3rd shift for the Third Quarter.  There were 6 drills that were completed in 2022, with no dates listed for any of the drills completed in order to correspond to a particular quarter.\nSection 17a-145-96. Discharge of child\n•\tTwo closed records did not contain documentation that identified person(s) that took legal custody of clients when discharge from the program.\nSection 17a-145-78. Recreational facilities\n•\tShift change notes were reviewed and there was no documentation to support that the program was providing recreational activities, for clients in the community on a consistent basis. Director Greene was interviewed and confirmed that due to high-risk behaviors of clients the program had not been scheduling community activities on a regular basis.\nSection 17a-145-98. Case records. Reports. Confidentiality\n•\tOne file did not contain a placement agreement.\nRecommendation: No recommendations made in this report.\nOnce the Licensing Unit has reviewed and accepted the service development plan and has determined that your agency is in compliance with the regulations, a decision on the issuance of a regular twenty-four month license for the program will be made.  Until DCF makes this decision, the current license will remain in effect.

This inspection was conducted to determine the compliance of this program with the DCF Regulations for Operation of Child-Caring Agencies and Facilities 17a-145-48 through 17a-145-124. Additionally, a review was conducted on 11-30-23 by DCF Nurse Consultant Errolee Miller, RN to determine the program’s compliance with the DCF Medication Administration Guidelines and the DCF Nursing Standards. A full standard of compliance was issued. A copy of the nursing site visit summary report is included with this report.\nListed below are the areas of regulatory non-compliance which were identified during the re-licensing inspection. Please review the areas identified and submit a service development plan (SDP) to address each area of noncompliance utilizing the SDP template included with this report. The service development plan must be submitted to the assigned Regulatory Consultant within 30 days of receipt of this emailed report.\nAlso included in this report are recommendations.  Recommendations are meant to highlight areas that are not currently areas of non-compliance, but may become non-compliant if actions are not taken, or, highlight areas for improvement. Recommendations do not require the submission of a service development plan.\nThe areas of regulatory noncompliance are as follows:\n17a-145-86\tInstructions in Safety Procedures. Supervision\n•\tIn 2022, Quarter 4 is missing fire drills for 1st and 3rd shift. In 2023, Quarter 1 is missing fire drills for 2nd and 3rd shift, and Quarter 2 is missing fire drills for 2nd and 3rd shift.\nSection 17a-145-96.
